# Netflix-js

Brief explanation

We chose to make a user interface for Netflix data for users to be able to compare their favorite movies and Tv shows. We got our data from 2 different CSVs from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data, kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows). We want to make a map based on how many movies and TV shows have been released in each country. Do ratings comparison based on movies/shows release date. We want to make our interface dynamic by incorporating inputs and dropdown menus to allow users to interact with our data set and create new visualizations.

Ideas:
Look up different directors and they're hometowns to see which hometowns make the best directors based on ratings
Netflix Categories vs. Ratings
Bar chart that has how many movies / tv shows were released per year.
Duration vs. Rating
Count actors and actresses to see which ones are most seen in Netflix movies
